# Deploying Iris Dataset Trained Classification Model Using Flask Server

This repository contains the code and resources to deploy a trained classification model for the Iris dataset using a Flask server. The deployed model allows users to input features of an Iris flower and receive predictions of its species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) in real-time.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the model, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or later)
- Flask (1.1.2 or later)
- scikit-learn (0.24.2 or later)
- pandas (1.2.3 or later)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification-flask.git
cd iris-classification-flask


```
Run the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py

```
1. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

2. You will be presented with a web interface where you can input the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an Iris flower.

3. After entering the features, click the "Predict" button. The server will use the trained model to predict the species of the Iris flower and display the result on the webpage.

## Customization
The trained model is stored in the model.pkl file. If you have a different trained model, replace this file with your own.
The Flask web interface is defined in the templates/index.html file. You can modify the HTML and styling to suit your preferences.
The route for predicting the Iris species is defined in the app.py file. You can customize this route or add additional routes as needed.
Deployment
To deploy this Flask app to a production environment, consider using a production-ready web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI. You can also consider deploying it to cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
